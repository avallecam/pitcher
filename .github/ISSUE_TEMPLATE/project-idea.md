# <*project-name*>: <*project-title*>

## Description

Describe the project in a few sentences, using non-technical terms as much as possible.



## Target audience

* typical end-users: <*Who do you think this project will be useful to?*>

* potential contributors: <*Do you already know people, or generic profiles of people who might contribute to developing the project?*>

* key collaborators: <*Are there any key partners or institutions already identified, who will need to input on this project?*>



## Usage

The code below illustrates a typical use of the package, using fictitious code and outputs if needed:

```r
library(project-name)

# Use case 1: 
some_data %>%
  do_some_analysis() %>%
  summarises_results() 

# some fake outputs
# ...

# Use case 2: 
some_data %>%
  do_some_other_analysis() %>%
  plot_results() 

# example of other outputs you would expect
# ...

```
